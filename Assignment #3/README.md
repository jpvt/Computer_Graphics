# The Graphics Pipeline


## **Abstract**

In this assignment, I will implement geometric transformations that make up the structure of the graphic pipeline. This implementation will be done with the help of the GLM library and its execution will occur in the OpenGL shaders. This activity will be done from a C++ template code provided by the professor, which is available in the [course's repository](https://github.com/capagot/icg).

NOTE: This is the short version of the assignment's article. If you want the long version explaining details about the graphics pipeline, please access the [long version](article.md).

## **Introduction**

In the context of computer graphics, the graphics pipeline is a conceptual model that describes what steps a graphics system needs to perform to render a 3D scene to a 2D screen. It consists of a series of algebraic transformations that are divided into a few stages.
