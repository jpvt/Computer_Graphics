# The Graphics Pipeline


## **Abstract**

In this assignment, I will implement geometric transformations that make up the structure of the graphic pipeline. This implementation will be done with the help of the GLM library and its execution will occur in the OpenGL shaders. This activity will be done from a C++ template code provided by the professor, which is available in the [course's repository](https://github.com/capagot/icg).

## **Introduction**

In the context of computer graphics, the graphics pipeline is a conceptual model that describes what steps a graphics system needs to perform to render a 3D scene to a 2D screen. It consists of a series of algebraic transformations that are divided into a few stages. In this article, I will explain all the steps of the graphics pipeline and demonstrate them with some code.

### **Object Space**

</p>

The object space is the 3-dimensional space in which a graphic object is defined. In this space, the object's position depends only on the object itself. It is in this space that transformations related to the object, such as translation, rotation, and scaling occur. These transformations will be explained later in this article.

### **World Space**

</p>

The world space is the 3-dimensional space in which the position of the objects no longer depends on themselves, but their positions on the point they occupy in the space. This space can contain multiple objects, each one with their own object space.

### **Camera Space**

</p>

The camera space adds new points of view to the scenes represented in the world space. This conjunct of views is represented by the camera space.

### **Clipping and Canonical Space**

</p>

In the clipping space, a subspace of the scene, which is represented by the cube in the image above, is selected and will be the space that the next transformations will be applied to spam the canonical space..

In the canonical space perspective distortions were applied to the space, to cause, or not, the illusion of depth.

</p>

### **Screen Space**

In the screen space, the canonical space pixels are addressed through the screen, then we can see a 3-dimensional transformed into a 2-dimensional image.

## **Geometric Transformations**

To go through the graphics pipeline, geometric transformations are made from one space to another. Most of these transformations are made by a linear operator, which in this case will be a matrix over the vectors that compose an object, transforming them from one vector space to another. The main transformations that will be covered in this article are:

* Scale;
* Shear;
* Rotation;
* Translatation.

Geometric transformations can be classified as:

* **Linear transformations:**
  - Maps straight lines to straight lines;
  - Can be expressed in matrix form;
  - Examples:
    * Scale, rotation and shear.
  
* **Affine transformations:**
  - Include all linear transformations;
  - Preserves parallelism between lines;
  - Examples:
    * Scale, rotation, shear and *translation*.

* **Projective transformations:**
  - Include all affine transformations;
  - Keep straight lines straight;
  - Do not preserve parallelism between lines;
  - Examples:
    * Scale, rotation, shear, translation and *homogeneous projection*.

### **Scaling**

</p>

The most basic transform is a *scale*. This transform can change length and possibly direction:

With Cartesian components (x,y):

For example, the matrix that increases x and y uniformly by a factor of two is:
