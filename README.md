## Assignments:

 *  [Assignment #1: Introduction to Rasterization Algorithms](https://github.com/jpvt/Computer_Graphics/tree/master/Assignment%20%231)

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/jpvt/jpvt.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/rasterization/initial_img.png" >
</p>

<p align="center">
In this assignment, I implemented algorithms for the rasterization of points and lines. The rasterization of these primitives will be done by simulating direct access to video memory. As current operating systems protect memory from direct access, I will use a framework, provided by the professor, that simulates access to video memory.
</p>


*  [Assignment #2: Setting up OpenGL](https://github.com/jpvt/Computer_Graphics/tree/master/Assignment%20%232)

<div align="center">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug2uIIbkVcU"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ug2uIIbkVcU/0.jpg" alt="Modern OpenGL"></a>
</div>

<p align="center">
In this assignment, I'll show how to set up Modern OpenGL on Linux and how to run a simple image. Click on the image to check the video.
</p>

*  [Assignment #3: The Graphics Pipeline](https://github.com/jpvt/Computer_Graphics/tree/master/Assignment%20%233)

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/cover3.gif" >
</p>

<p align="center">
In this assignment, I will implement geometric transformations that make up the structure of the graphic pipeline. This implementation will be done with the help of the GLM library and its execution will occur in the OpenGL shaders.
</p>

*  [Assignment #4: Basic Lighting](https://github.com/jpvt/Computer_Graphics/tree/master/Assignment%20%234)

    <p align="center">
      <img src="imgs/cover4.png"  width="500px" >
    </p>

<p align="center">
In this assignment, I will implement lighting models traditionally used in rasterization: ambient, diffuse, and specular (or Phong). For this task, I will implement the three models using OpenGL's vertex shader.
</p>

<sub>*Computer Engineering undergrad student* at Universidade Federal da Paraíba</sub>

Hey, I'm João Pedro. (Since it's a complicated name to pronounce in english, you can call me JP)

I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. Though, I have spent most of my life where I currently live João Pessoa, Brazil.

I'm a Computer Engineering Undergrad student at the [Federal University of Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br), and a Machine Learning Researcher at [ArIA - Artificial Intelligence Applications Laboratory](https://aria.ci.ufpb.br), where I've been studying Artificial Intelligence for the past months.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning random stuff, traveling, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and caffeine :)

**Background in:** C/C++, Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.
